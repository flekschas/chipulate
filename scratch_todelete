Inputs ---
1) Genome file (required)
2) Tab-separated file BED file containing chromosome coordinates, occupancies of true positive regions. (required)
3) Tab-separated file containing chromosome coordinates, occupancies of false positive regions. (optional)
4) Read length (default : 42 bp)  
5) Single-end or paired-end (optional. default : single-end)
6) Fragment length (default : 300bp. Allow distributions too by specifying a filename). 

Unsure : 
To what extent do I rely on PWM inputs?
If yes,
Option (1)
-> Find a conversion factor between motif scores and energies.

Option (2)
-> Find motif matches. Set a cut-off score. Consider +/- 200 bp around each site. Merge overlapping regions.   
    
Danger with both options (1) and (2) is that you could end up with occupancy probabilities that are very
small. This necessitates increasing the number of cells in the simulation, which in turn really
slows things down. 

So I will have to port the amplification and sequencing steps over to C++.
